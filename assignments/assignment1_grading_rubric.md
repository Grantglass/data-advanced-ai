## Grading Notes (Instructor Use)

**Time to Grade:** Approximately 30-40 minutes per assignment

**Common Issues to Watch For:**
1. Student uses same prompt with minor variations instead of truly different techniques
2. No quantitative analysis in comparative section
3. Generic strategic recommendations not tailored to scenario
4. Copy-paste from lecture examples without original application
5. Unrealistic scenarios too complex for assignment scope

**Calibration:** Grade first 3 assignments together with teaching team to ensure consistency
