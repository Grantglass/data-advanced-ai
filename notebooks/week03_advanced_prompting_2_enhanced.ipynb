    "\n",
    "1. **Problem decomposition** is essential for complex tasks:\n",
    "   - Least-to-Most: Build from simple to complex\n",
    "   - Plan-and-Solve: Strategic top-down planning\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Self-correction techniques** improve output quality:\n",
    "   - Self-Refine: Iterative improvement through self-critique\n",
    "   - Chain-of-Verification: Reduce hallucinations through self-verification\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trade-offs exist**:\n",
    "   - Higher quality often requires more tokens\n",
    "   - Multiple iterations increase cost and latency\n",
    "   - Choose techniques based on task criticality\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combining approaches** can be powerful:\n",
    "   - Use decomposition + self-refine for complex, high-stakes tasks\n",
    "   - Add verification for factual accuracy requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prompt engineering is evolving**:\n",
    "   - These techniques represent current best practices\n",
    "   - New methods continue to emerge\n",
    "   - Experimentation and testing remain critical"
