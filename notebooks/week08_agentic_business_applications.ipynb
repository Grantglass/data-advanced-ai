    "1. **Real-world success requires more than technology** - data quality, change management, and governance are critical\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Start small, scale gradually** - pilot projects build confidence and learnings before major investments\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measure everything** - clear metrics enable continuous improvement and ROI demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Human-agent collaboration beats pure automation** - agents augment human expertise, not replace it\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Common challenges are predictable** - learn from others' experiences to avoid pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Not every problem needs agents** - simpler solutions may be more appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Implementation is as important as design** - execution determines success"
