Core Principles of Prompt Engineering\n\n### Key Principles:\n\n1. **Clarity**: Make your instructions explicit and unambiguous\n2. **Context**: Provide relevant background information\n3. **Specificity**: Be precise about what you want\n4. **Structure**: Organize prompts logically\n5. **Examples**: Use examples when appropriate (we'll explore this more in Week 2)\n\n> 💡 **Key Insight**: According to research by OpenAI and Anthropic, well-structured prompts can improve output quality by 40-60% compared to vague instructions.\n\n### Understanding LLM Processing\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) work by:\n- Tokenizing input text\n- Processing tokens through neural network layers\n- Predicting the most likely next tokens\n- Generating coherent responses based on training data patterns\n\n**Key Limitation**: LLMs don't \"understand\" in a human sense; they recognize patterns and generate statistically likely continuations.\n\n#### How LLMs Process Your Prompts\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  INPUT: Your Prompt                              │\n└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘\n                   │\n                   ▼\n         ┌─────────────────┐\n         │  1. Tokenization │\n         │  \"Hello\" → [15496]│\n         └────────┬─────────┘\n                  │\n                  ▼\n       ┌──────────────────────┐\n       │  2.
