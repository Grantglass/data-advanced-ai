Core Principles of Prompt Engineering\n\n### Key Principles:\n\n1. **Clarity**: Make your instructions explicit and unambiguous\n2. **Context**: Provide relevant background information\n3. **Specificity**: Be precise about what you want\n4. **Structure**: Organize prompts logically\n5. **Examples**: Use examples when appropriate (we'll explore this more in Week 2)\n\n> 💡 **Key Insight**: According to research by OpenAI and Anthropic, well-structured prompts can improve output quality by 40-60% compared to vague instructions.\n\n### Understanding LLM Processing\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) work by:\n- Tokenizing input text\n- Processing tokens through neural network layers\n- Predicting the most likely next tokens\n- Generating coherent responses based on training data patterns\n\n**Key Limitation**: LLMs don't \"understand\" in a human sense; they recognize patterns and generate statistically likely continuations.\n\n#### How LLMs Process Your Prompts\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  INPUT: Your Prompt                              │\n└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘\n                   │\n                   ▼\n         ┌─────────────────┐\n         │  1. Tokenization │\n         │  \"Hello\" → [15496]│\n         └────────┬─────────┘\n                  │\n                  ▼\n       ┌──────────────────────┐\n       │  2. Neural Processing │\n       │  (Attention Layers)   │\n       └──────────┬───────────┘\n                  │\n                  ▼\n      ┌───────────────────────┐\n      │  3.

They only \"know\" what was in their training data (typically with a cutoff date)."

You have a solid foundation in prompt engineering fundamentals. You're ready for Week 2's advanced techniques.\n\n### 🤔 If you couldn't check some boxes:\nNo problem! Review the specific sections you're uncertain about:\n- **Principles**: Revisit Section 1 (Core Principles)\n- **Prompt Types**: Review Section 2 and Examples in Section 3\n- **Evaluation**: Study Section 4 (Evaluation Framework)\n- **Application**: Complete the hands-on exercise in Section 6\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Pro Tips for Week 2 Preparation\n\n1. **Start a Prompt Library**: Save your best prompts from this week\n2. **Document What Works**: Note which approaches worked for different tasks\n3. **Identify Complexity**: Find a task that needs multi-step reasoning for Week 2\n4. **Think About Examples**: Consider scenarios where showing examples would help",
