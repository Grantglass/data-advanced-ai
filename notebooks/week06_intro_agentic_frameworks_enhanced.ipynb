   "source": "## 1. What is an Agentic System?\n\n### Definition\n\nAn **agentic system** is an AI system that can:\n- **Perceive** its environment and task requirements\n- **Plan** a sequence of actions to achieve goals\n- **Reason** about options and consequences\n- **Act** using available tools and interfaces\n- **Learn** from feedback and adapt behavior\n- **Operate autonomously** with minimal human intervention\n\n> 💡 **Key Insight**: The term \"agentic\" comes from \"agency\" - the capacity to act independently and make choices. In business AI, this means systems that can handle complex tasks with minimal step-by-step instructions.\n\n### Key Characteristics\n\n1. **Autonomy**: Can make decisions and take actions independently\n2. **Goal-Directedness**: Works toward specific objectives\n3. **Reactivity**: Responds to changes in the environment\n4. **Pro-activeness**: Takes initiative to achieve goals\n5. **Social Ability**: Can interact with other agents and humans\n6. **Learning**: Improves performance over time\n\n#### Agent Components and Flow\n\n```\n┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│              AGENTIC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE            │\n└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n    ┌──────────────┐\n    │ PERCEPTION   │ ← Environment, User Input, Data\n    │ (Sense)      │\n    └──────┬───────┘\n           │\n           ▼\n    ┌──────────────┐\n    │   MEMORY     │\n    │ • Short-term │ ← Context, History\n    │ • Long-term  │\n    └──────┬───────┘\n           │\n           ▼\n    ┌──────────────┐\n    │  REASONING   │\n    │ (Think)      │ ← Goals, Constraints\n    └──────┬───────┘\n           │\n           ▼\n    ┌──────────────┐\n    │  PLANNING    │\n    │ (Strategize) │ → Multi-step Plans\n    └──────┬───────┘\n           │\n           ▼\n    ┌──────────────┐\n    │   ACTION     │\n    │ (Execute)    │ → Tools, APIs, Systems\n    └──────┬───────┘\n           │\n           ▼\n    ┌──────────────┐\n    │   LEARNING   │\n    │ (Adapt)      │ ← Feedback, Outcomes\n    └──────────────┘\n           │\n           └──────┐\n                  │\n             [LOOP BACK]\n```\n\n> ⚠️ **Common Pitfall**: Don't confuse \"agentic AI\" with simple automation. If you can write it as an if-then-else script, it's not agentic - it's automation. Agents handle scenarios where the path to success isn't predefined."

The agent **reasoned through** each unique situation, chose appropriate tools, and adapted its approach - true agentic behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Case Study 2: Deloitte's Regulatory Compliance Agent\n\n**Company**: Deloitte (Professional Services)  \n**Challenge**: Monitor constantly changing regulations across 150 countries for clients  \n**Solution**: Multi-agent system for regulatory intelligence\n\n**Agentic Architecture**:\n```\n┌─────────────────┐       ┌──────────────────┐       ┌─────────────────┐\n│  MONITOR AGENT  │ ───→  │  ANALYSIS AGENT  │ ───→  │  ALERT AGENT    │\n│ • Web scraping  │       │ • Impact assess  │       │ • Prioritize    │\n│ • Source track  │       │ • Compare rules  │       │ • Route to team │\n└─────────────────┘       └──────────────────┘       └─────────────────┘\n         │                         │                         │\n         └─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘\n                                   │\n                          ┌────────────────┐\n                          │  MEMORY STORE  │\n                          │ • Regulations  │\n                          │ • Client rules │\n                          └────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Agentic Capabilities**:\n- **Monitor Agent**: Continuously scans regulatory bodies, news sources (autonomy)\n- **Analysis Agent**: Reasons about impact on specific clients (reasoning + planning)\n- **Alert Agent**: Decides urgency level, routes to appropriate team (decision-making)\n- **Memory**: Maintains regulatory history, client-specific requirements (context)\n\n**Results**:\n- **95% reduction** in missed regulatory changes\n- **40-60% faster** client notifications\n- **3x increase** in regulatory coverage (more jurisdictions monitored)\n- **$15M annual value** from avoided penalties and improved advisory\n\n> 💡 **Key Learning**: Multiple specialized agents working together can handle complexity beyond any single system. Each agent has autonomy within its domain while collaborating toward shared goals.\n\n---\n\n### Case Study 3: Morgan Stanley's Financial Advisor Agent\n\n**Company**: Morgan Stanley (Financial Services)  \n**Challenge**: 16,000 financial advisors need to search across 100,000+ research documents  \n**Solution**: GPT-4 based agentic system\n\n**Agentic Workflow**:\n1. **Perceive**: Understand advisor's client context and question\n2. **Plan**: Break complex query into sub-questions\n3. **Search**: Use multiple retrieval strategies across document corpus\n4. **Reason**: Synthesize findings, identify contradictions or gaps\n5. **Act**: Generate actionable insights specific to client situation\n6. **Cite**: Provide source documents for verification\n\n**Results**:\n- **Deployed to all 16,000 advisors** (enterprise-wide adoption)\n- **Productivity increase**: 10-15% more time with clients\n- **Knowledge access**: Previously buried insights now discoverable\n- **Compliance**: Better documentation of advice rationale\n\n> 💡 **Key Learning**: The system doesn't just retrieve documents (that's search) or answer questions (that's a chatbot). It **plans a research strategy**, **reasons about** what information is relevant, and **synthesizes insights** - demonstrating true agentic capabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Why These Are Agentic (Not Just \"Smart Software\")\n\n| Capability | Klarna CS | Deloitte Reg | Morgan Stanley | Why It's Agentic |\n|------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Autonomy** | Handles cases end-to-end | Monitors without prompting | Researches independently | Makes decisions without step-by-step instructions |\n| **Planning** | Multi-step resolution paths | Coverage strategy | Research plans | Determines HOW to achieve goals |\n| **Reasoning** | Context-appropriate responses | Impact assessment | Synthesis of findings | Thinks through problems dynamically |\n| **Tool Use** | Database, refund, KB | Web scrapers, analyzers | Search, retrieval, citation | Uses multiple tools strategically |\n| **Adaptation** | Learns from satisfaction | Updates monitoring sources | Improves relevance | Changes behavior based on feedback |",

    "## 9. Discussion Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent vs. Automation**: What distinguishes an \"agentic\" system from a standard automation script or a simple chatbot in a business context? Provide an example task where agentic capabilities would be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Autonomy Levels**: How much autonomy should business agents have? Where do you draw the line for requiring human oversight?\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Key Insight**: 3. **Trust and Reliability**: What would make you trust an agentic system to handle important business tasks? What safeguards are needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Planning Complexity**: For your use case, how many steps ahead should an agent plan? What are the risks of over-planning vs. under-planning?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tool Access**: Which business tools/systems should agents be allowed to access? What access controls are necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Failure Modes**: How should an agent behave when it encounters a problem it can't solve? When should it escalate to humans?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Value Assessment**: How do you evaluate whether implementing an agentic system is worth the investment vs. simpler alternatives?"

    "2. **Agents differ fundamentally from automation and chatbots** through their ability to plan, reason dynamically, and operate with meaningful autonomy\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The perception-action loop is fundamental** to agent behavior: perceive → reason → plan → act → observe → repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ReAct framework interleaves reasoning and acting**, enabling more transparent and effective problem-solving\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Different architectures serve different purposes** - choose based on task complexity, observability, and learning requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Business value comes from handling complex, multi-step tasks** that are difficult to pre-program or script\n",
    "\n",
