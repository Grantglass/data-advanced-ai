## Course Description

This advanced MBA elective equips future business leaders with the strategic knowledge and practical skills to effectively leverage large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic AI systems. As AI transforms every business function, leaders must understand not just what these systems can do, but how to deploy them strategically, evaluate their effectiveness, and govern their use responsibly.

Through hands-on Python programming exercises, case studies, and strategic analysis, students will master:
- **Prompt Engineering**: From fundamentals to advanced techniques (Chain-of-Thought, RAG, Self-Refine)
- **Agentic Systems**: Understanding autonomous AI systems that can perceive, reason, and act
- **Strategic Implementation**: Building tech-ready operating models and governance frameworks
- **Business Applications**: ROI measurement, risk assessment, and competitive positioning

**Prerequisites:**
- MBA core courses completed (or instructor permission)
- Basic Python familiarity helpful but not required (tutorials provided)
- Access to laptop for in-class exercises

**No prior AI or programming experience required.** All technical concepts will be taught from a business perspective.
