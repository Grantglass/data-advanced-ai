Advanced AI Strategy: Prompting and Agentic Frameworks - Spring 2026

Introduction
This course is designed for leaders and strategists who already possess a foundational understanding of core technologies and seek to delve deeper into advanced interaction paradigms like prompt engineering and the strategic implications of agentic systems. Specifically, we will focus on mastering techniques for interacting with sophisticated language models, evaluating their outputs, understanding the architecture and application of agentic frameworks, and developing robust strategies for their implementation and governance within organizations.
Recognizing the need for leaders to move beyond basic awareness of AI and towards strategic application:
 The class emphasizes practical skills in prompt design, evaluation methodologies for complex model outputs, and frameworks for assessing the opportunities and risks of autonomous systems.
It addresses the critical aspects of building tech-ready operating models and cultures, ensuring responsible and ethical deployment, developing coherent technology strategies, measuring return on investment (ROI), and anticipating future technological trends.
The course structure progresses from mastering prompt engineering to understanding agentic systems, implementation strategies, governance, and future outlooks.

Course Evaluations
End of Semester Evaluation

ClassEval is the end-of-semester survey for students to evaluate instruction of all university classes. The current survey is administered online and includes 12 closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. Deans, department heads, and instructors may add a limited number of their own questions to these 15 common-core questions. 

Each semester students’ responses are compiled into a ClassEval report for every instructor and class. Instructors use the evaluations to improve instruction and include them in their promotion and tenure dossiers, while department heads use them in annual reviews. The reports are included in instructors’ personnel files and are considered confidential.

Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of the semester for full semester courses and the last week of shorter sessions. Students will receive an email directing them to a website to complete class evaluations. These become unavailable at 8am on the first day of finals.
